# Database Model: CryoET + AI Portal

This document enumerates every field that will be stored in the portal database, organized by entity (Sample → Acquisition → Tomogram → Annotation). For each field it lists the data type and the **authoritative source**:

| Source | What it means |
|---|---|
| `sample.toml` | Researcher-authored sample-level metadata — one file at the sample root. Field definitions live in `schema.py`. Section shown in parentheses. |
| `acquisition.toml` | Researcher-authored per-acquisition parameters and processing log (`[raw_tomogram]`, `[[post_processed_tomogram]]`, `[[annotation]]` entries) — one file in each acquisition directory. Section shown in parentheses. |
| `MDOC` | Parsed from `.mdoc` files in the `Frames/` directory by `ingest_mdoc.py`. |
| `.eer` / `.tiff` | Derived from frame file extension or EER header metadata. |
| `MRC header` | Read from the `.mrc` file header on ingest. |
| `OME-Zarr .zattrs` | Read from the multiscale metadata in `.ome.zarr` arrays. |
| `directory` | Implicit from the prescribed directory structure (sample dir name, acquisition dir name, processing folder name). |
| `derived` | Computed on ingest from other DB fields (e.g., tilt range formatted string). |

Researcher-authored fields live in one of two files: sample-level metadata in `sample.toml` at the sample root, and per-acquisition parameters plus the processing log in `acquisition.toml` inside each acquisition directory. Both files are governed by `schema.py`; the section in parentheses identifies the TOML table (`[sample]`, `[chromatin]`, `[acquisition]`, `[raw_tomogram]`, `[[post_processed_tomogram]]`, etc.). Fields coming from any other source are **not** entered by researchers and are not duplicated in either TOML (no-duplication principle).

**Key annotations**: `(PK)` marks a **primary key** — the column that uniquely identifies each row in that table. `(FK)` marks a **foreign key** — a column whose value references the primary key of another table, used to link rows across entities (e.g., a tomogram's `acquisition_id` points back to its parent acquisition row).

### 2a. Tilt series sub-entity (0..N per acquisition)

One row per tilt series within an acquisition. Primary key:
`(sample_id, acquisition_id, tilt_series_id)`, where `tilt_series_id` is the
name of the folder under `TiltSeries/`. These rows are **researcher-authored**
as `[[tilt_series]]` blocks in `acquisition.toml` (one block per `TiltSeries/{tilt_series_id}/`
folder — there is no per-folder `tiltseries.toml`); the catalog scanner enriches
each authored row with filesystem-derived paths and timestamps. **Multiple tilt
series per acquisition are expected** — a raw/unaligned series (not required), an
aligned series derived from either the frames or the raw tilt series, another alignment derived from the first alignment, etc.

Each `TiltSeries/{tilt_series_id}/` folder holds a `stack/` subdirectory (the
`.mrc` projection stack, plus optional `.zarr` / `.rawtlt`; may be empty) and an
`alignment/` subdirectory (`alignment.json` affine matrix + interpolation recipe).
Alignment is no longer a separate top-level entity — it is folded into the tilt
series as transformation parameters (`is_aligned`, `alignment_software`,
`alignment_method`, plus the discovered `alignment_files`).

The MDOC-derived **tilt geometry now lives on the parent `Acquisition`** (see
the `tilt_angles` field above and the related `tilt_min` / `tilt_max` /
`tilt_axis` / `pixel_size` / `voltage` fields). The MDOC stays in `Frames/` and
describes the acquisition's tilt scheme, shared by all of its tilt series, so the
polar plot is rendered at the acquisition level rather than per tilt series.

| Field | Type | Source | Source Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tilt_series_id` | text (PK) | `directory` ↔ `acquisition.toml` (`[[tilt_series]].id`) | researcher authored | Folder name under `TiltSeries/`; the TOML `id` must match the folder. |
| `acquisition_id` | text (FK) | `directory` | derived | Parent acquisition folder name. |
| `sample_id` | text (FK) | `directory` | derived | Parent sample folder name. |
| `derived_from` | text | `acquisition.toml` (`[[tilt_series]]`) | researcher authored | Either the literal `"Frames"` or another `tilt_series_id` in the same acquisition. |
| `is_aligned` | boolean | `acquisition.toml` (`[[tilt_series]]`) | researcher authored | Whether the stack is already geometrically transformed (aligned). |
| `alignment_software` | text | `acquisition.toml` (`[[tilt_series]]`) | researcher authored | e.g. `IMOD`, `AreTomo3`. |
| `alignment_method` | text | `acquisition.toml` (`[[tilt_series]]`) | researcher authored | e.g. `fiducial`, `patch_tracking`, `feature_tracking`. |
| `st_path` | text | `directory` | derived | Path to the stacked tilt-series `.mrc` file, resolved under `{tilt_series_id}/stack/`. |
| `zarr_path` | text | `directory` | derived | Path to the OME-Zarr rendering under `{tilt_series_id}/stack/`, when present. |
| `alignment_files` | list[text] | `directory` | derived | Alignment artifacts discovered under `{tilt_series_id}/alignment/`. |
| `mtime` | float | `directory` | derived | Modification time, used to gate re-parsing. |

### 2b. MD source sub-entity (one per acquisition; simulation data only)

`acquisition.toml` (`[md_source]`) — records which MD run + frame this acquisition's synthetic data came from. Rejected on `experimental` samples.

| Field | Type | Source | Source Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `md_run_id` | text (FK) | `acquisition.toml` (`[md_source]`) | researcher authored | Should match an `MdRuns/{id}/` folder name in the sample; a dangling ref warns rather than failing the acquisition. |
| `frame` | integer | `acquisition.toml` (`[md_source]`) | researcher authored | Frame/snapshot index within the MD run. |

---

## 3. Tomogram entities

Raw and post-processed tomograms are split into two tables. They share one
`tomogram_id` namespace within an acquisition: `derived_from` and an
annotation's `target_tomogram` may reference either a raw or a post-processed
tomogram in the same `acquisition.toml`.

### 3a. Raw tomogram (one row per acquisition, optional)

| `voxel_size` | float | `MRC header` | derived | Ångström/pixel. Populated by the catalog scanner from the reconstruction MRC header's `voxel_size.x`; not authored in any TOML. |
| `derived_from` | list[text] | `acquisition.toml` (`[[post_processed_tomogram]]`) | researcher authored | Lineage; references a raw or post-processed `tomogram_id` in this acquisition. |
