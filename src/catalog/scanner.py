"""Scanner orchestrator.

scan_root walks the data root, runs the gating check, dispatches per-sample
to the assembler + persistence layer inside a transaction, and tracks the
overall run via the `scan_runs` table (one row per invocation, status running/
completed/failed) and a per-sample ScanReport returned to the caller.

Issues are reconciled (not delete-then-inserted): each sample's fresh issue set
is diffed against its stored outstanding issues so first-seen survives across
runs and resolution is detected when a re-evaluated sample stops emitting an
issue. Logs are buffered in memory by a synchronous loguru sink and persisted
in a single bulk insert at run end (single-writer SQLite contract).

Single-writer contract: running two scan_root calls against the same
DB simultaneously is undefined. The CLI takes no advisory lock; the operator
is responsible for serializing scans.
