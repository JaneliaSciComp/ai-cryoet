"""GET /md-previews/{relpath:path} — stream a cached OVITO/MD preview PNG.

These previews are rendered upstream by aicryoet-tools (OVITO TachyonRenderer)
into a flat ``.portal_cache`` directory; filenames look like
``{data_type}_{sampleId}..._preview.png``. For now this route only *serves*
the cache — generation/scanning of these PNGs lands later. Mirrors the
thumbnails route (sync handler + path-traversal guard + cache headers).
